1. For the parser construction stage, your group should choose to implement either a recursive descent parser or a LL(1) parser.
    Indicate and justify your choice of one of these two parsing strategies.

2. Further, using your sample program based on your mini-grammar, demonstrate:
    a. How your chosen parsing strategy would generate a parse tree for a syntactically-correct token stream and
    b. How your chosen parsing strategy would generate an error message for a syntactically-incorrect token stream.

NB: Designate one team member who will compile and submit the assignment on behalf of the group.
 Ensure that you indicate your group number and group members (names and reg nos) on the first page of the submitted document.
