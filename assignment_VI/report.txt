We have decided to use Flex too for the lexical analysis.
Flex will scan our program and generate tokens that will be passed to the,
parser. We also use the parser generator tool YACC.

We have declared the regular expressions for the tokens in our language, 
we are still fine tuning our actions based on those tokens.

Currentl we are workining on fine tuning the actions and we will update the,
the project when our program is complete.
