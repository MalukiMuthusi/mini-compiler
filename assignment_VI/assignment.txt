Submit a brief report that includes the following:
1. Source code
2. Token list
3. Screenshot showing the scanner's output on the command line.

Note that you will make live demos of your scanners on 8th March, 
so ensure that one member in your group is able to demo the working of your scanner 
during the google meet session at 3.45pm. 
Remember that each group member should submit the group report individually, 
and ensure you clearly indicate your group number and members.
